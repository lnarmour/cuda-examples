# use the cuda debugger to inspect

This illustrates how to use the debugger `cuda-gdb`.
The binary must be compiled with the debug flags `-g -G`, which the provided makefile already does.

Do the following:

1) compile with debug flags
```
$ make
nvcc -g -G main.cu -o vadd
```

2) launch the program in the debugger without running it yet with `cuda-gbd ./vadd`:
```
$ cuda-gdb ./vadd

```
Notice that the shell prompt changes to `(cuda-gdb)`.

3) set a breakpoint in the kernel function with `b mykernel`
```
(cuda-gdb) b mykernel
Breakpoint 1 at 0x403c17: file main.cu, line 4.
```

4) launch the program for N=150 with `r 150`:
```
(cuda-gdb) r 150

[Switching focus to CUDA kernel 0, grid 1, block (0,0,0), thread (0,0,0), device 0, sm 0, warp 0, lane 0]

Thread 1 "vadd" hit Breakpoint 1, mykernel<<<(2,1,1),(64,1,1)>>> (a=0x7fffc6400000, b=0x7fffc6400400, c=0x7fffc6400800) at main.cu:5
5	  int i = blockIdx.x * 64 + threadIdx.x;
```

This is the same interface as the traditional C command line debugger (gdb), and all of the same commands work.
Notice the additional information we can see here related to the GPU "focus", primarily:
* `block (0,0,0)` 
* `thread (0,0,0)`

In other words, the current debug prompt is fixed to the perspective of the 0th thread in the 0th block.
Really, keep in mind that the block and thread ID's are multidimensional.
In this example, we're using 1D grid dims and 1D block dims, so the 0th block as an ID (0,0,0).

5) step over the current line with the `n` (i.e., next) command
```
(cuda-gdb) n
7	  c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
```
Execution stops now on the next line.

6) print out the value of the variable `i` to the screen with the command `p i`:
```
(cuda-gdb) p i
$1 = 0
```
As expected the value of `i` is 0 because `blockIdx.x * 64 + threadIdx.x` evaluates to 0 for the 0th thread in the 0th block.

7) switch focus to the second block (i.e., block = (1,0,0)) with the command `cuda block (1,0,0):
```
(cuda-gdb) cuda block (1,0,0)
[Switching focus to CUDA kernel 0, grid 1, block (1,0,0), thread (0,0,0), device 0, sm 1, warp 0, lane 0]
5	  int i = blockIdx.x * 64 + threadIdx.x;
```
Notice that execution is caught ``back on'' the previous line.

8) step over the next instruction again with `n`:
```
(cuda-gdb) n
7	  c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
```

9) inspect the current CUDA focus with the command `cuda block thread` and print the value of `i` again:
```
(cuda-gdb) cuda block thread
block (1,0,0), thread (0,0,0)
(cuda-gdb) p i
$2 = 64
``` 
The value of `i` is 64, as expected for the block (1,0,0)
